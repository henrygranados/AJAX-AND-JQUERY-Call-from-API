# Ajax-Call-From-API

Project Summary

Site under Test http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/v2/Quote/jsonp
Live Demo could be found at: http://codepen.io/HenryGranados/pen/OVeXpr

This project was created as part of a technical assessment to retrieve data from an API at http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/v2/Quote/jsonp. The objective was to make an Ajax call using JQuery to retrieve some data from API related to "symbols" such as : APPL, MSFT, GE, etc. Basically the user enters the symbol value into the input field and after clicking on "Get Quote", the user will see all of the data in a table related to the symbol value they entered.
