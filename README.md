# AJAX-AND-JQUERY-Call-from-API

Project Summary

Site under Test http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/v2/Quote/jsonp

This project was created as part of a technical assessment to retrieve data from an API at http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/v2/Quote/jsonp. The objective was to make an Ajax call using JQuery to retrieve some data from API related to "symbols" such as : APPL, MSFT, GE, etc. Basically the user enters the symbol value into the input field and after clicking on "Get Quote", the users will see all of the data in a table related to the symbol value.
